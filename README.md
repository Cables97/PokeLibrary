# InterNational Dex

personal project 7 - InterNational Dex - The Convenient Poke Tracker
created by Caleb *Cables* Universe. June 2024.

This project was made with Vue.JS, and it's helpful Single-File Components.

## INFO

I started this project as practice developing with Vue.js.
I used the PokeApi from [https://pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co) for all the information in this project.


## Current State

So far, users can filter Pokemon by Type, and Base-stat, or searched by name. 
Pokemon can be favourited or marked as "Caught".
Selecting a pokemon's card will open a modal with more information about the pokemon.


## Future Plans

A team manager, where users can select up to 6 Pokemon to be on their "team".
Teams weaknesses and strengths are displayed in real time for clear optimization.
